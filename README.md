# Terasic-DE1-SoC-Projects
This repository hosts a collection of projects aimed at exploring the capabilities of the Terasic DE1-SoC development board, while also serving as a platform for learning digital design principles.

## About Terasic DE1-SoC
The Terasic DE1-SoC is a versatile development and education platform integrating an FPGA chip with an ARM-based SoC (System on Chip). It combines the flexibility of FPGA-based hardware acceleration with the familiarity of a general-purpose processor, making it ideal for learning and prototyping in the realm of hardware/software co-design.

## Learning Digital Design
Alongside exploring the capabilities of the DE1-SoC, this repository serves as a journey in learning digital design principles. Each project is an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in practical FPGA-based projects.

## Structure of This Repository
- **Project Folders**: Each project is organized into separate folders, containing project-specific files, documentation, and resources.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation including design rationale, circuit diagrams, and user guides can be found in the `docs/` folder.
- **Resources**: Additional resources such as datasheets, software tools, and reference materials are stored in the `resources/` folder.

## Getting Started
If you're new to the Terasic DE1-SoC or FPGA development in general, start by reading the README.md file in each project folder. It provides setup instructions, usage guidelines, and insights into the project goals and outcomes.
