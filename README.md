# Terasic-DE1-SoC-Projects
This repository hosts a collection of projects aimed at exploring the capabilities of the Terasic DE1-SoC development board, while also serving as a platform for learning digital design principles.

## About Terasic DE1-SoC
The Terasic DE1-SoC is a versatile development and education platform integrating an FPGA chip with an ARM-based SoC (System on Chip). It combines the flexibility of FPGA-based hardware acceleration with the familiarity of a general-purpose processor, making it ideal for learning and prototyping in the realm of hardware/software co-design.
